# TSC-Course
Repository made for the TSC course at VKI

My code is doing a POD decomposition of PIV data acquired during my first experimental campaign. This is inside the folder "src" and it is called "POD_first_experimental_campaign".

The ReadtheDocs has been done and it can be found here at this link: https://tsc-course-new.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
