# TSC-Course
Repository made for the TSC course at VKI

My code is doing a POD decomposition of PIV data acquired during my first experimental campaign. This is inside the folder "src" and it is called "main". 
In the same folder there is also a python file called "Functions" that are the actual functions that I used in the main
